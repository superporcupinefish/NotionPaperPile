              reflectance across a wide range of species, leaf structures and
              developmental stages",

  abstract = "Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the
              physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral
              reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment
              estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been
              developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in
              most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most
              a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can
              be applied across species with varying leaf structural
              characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop
              spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are
              relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation
              and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies
              without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of
              spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments
              occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously
              published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations
              with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of
              species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance
              appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By
              developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of
              differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to
              significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content.
              We also found that an index based on the first derivative of
              reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf
              structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not
              significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral
              reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin
              indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we
              found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally
              developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes)
              was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves.
              This result has important implications for the interpretation of
              PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results
              demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species
              with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for
              extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new
              possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in
              heterogeneous natural environments.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although the plant economic spectrum seeks
              to explain resource allocation strategies, carbohydrate storage
              is often omitted. Belowground storage organs are the centre of
              herb perennation, yet little is known about the role of their
              turnover, anatomy and carbohydrate storage in relation to the
              aboveground economic spectrum. METHODS: We collected aboveground
              traits associated with the economic spectrum, storage organ
              turnover traits, storage organ inner structure traits and storage
              carbohydrate concentrations for ~80 temperate meadow species. KEY
              RESULTS: The suites of belowground traits were largely
              independent of one another, but there was significant correlation
              of the aboveground traits with both inner structure and storage
              carbohydrates. Anatomical traits diverged according to leaf
              nitrogen concentration on the one hand and vessel area and dry
              matter content on the other; carbohydrates separated along
              gradients of leaf nitrogen concentration and plant height.
              CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our expectations, aboveground traits and
              not storage organ turnover were correlated with anatomy and
              storage carbohydrates. Belowground traits associated with the
              aboveground economic spectrum also did not fall clearly within
              the fast-slow economic continuum, thus indicating the presence of
              a more complicated economic space. Our study implies that the
              generally overlooked role of storage within the plant economic
              spectrum represents an important dimension of plant strategy.",

  abstract = "Understanding variation in leaf functional traits-including rates
              of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen
              and phosphorus-is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology.
              When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically
              increase with leaf mass per area (LMA) within species but are
              roughly independent of LMA across the global flora. LMA is
              determined by mass components with different biological
              functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines
              metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and
              structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (LL). A
              possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is
              that most LMA variation within species is associated with
              variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most LMA variation
              across the global flora is associated with variation in
              structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that
              (i) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf
              area should increase strongly with LMA across species assemblages
              with low LL variance but should increase weakly with LMA across
              species assemblages with high LL variance and that (ii)
              controlling for LL variation should increase the strength of the
              above LMA relationships. We present analyses of intra- and
              interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites
              and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global
              dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our
              analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait
              relationships exhibited by different leaf assemblages can be
              understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and
              structural mass components contribute to LMA variation in a given
              assemblage.",

              ecosystem status and function (e.g. carbon and water exchange
              between the land surface and the atmosphere). However, deriving
              accurate LAI measurements at regular temporal intervals remains
              challenging, requiring either destructive sampling or manual
              collection of canopy gap fraction measurements at discrete time
              intervals. In this study, we present four methods to obtain
              continuous LAI data, simply derived from above and below canopy
              measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the
              Borden Forest Research Station from 1999 to 2018. We compared LAI
              derived using the four PAR-based methods to independent
              measurements of LAI from optical methods and the MODIS satellite
              LAI product. LAI derived from all four PAR-based methods captured
              the seasonal changes in observed and remotely sensed LAI and
              showed a close linear correspondence with one another (R2 of 0.55
              to 0.76 compared to MODIS LAI, and R2 of 0.78 to 0.84 compared to
              LAI-2000 measurements). A PAR-based method using Miller's
              Integral theorem showed the strongest linear relationship with
              LAI-2000 measurements (R2=0.84, p<0.001, SE=0.40). In many years

  abstract = "The timing of leaf emergence in temperate and boreal forests is
              changing, which has profound implications for a wide array of
              ecosystem processes and services. Spring phenology models, which
              have been widely used to predict the timing of leaf emergence,
              generally assume that a combination of photoperiod and thermal
              forcing control when leaves emerge. However, the exact nature and
              magnitude of how photoperiod and temperature individually and
              jointly control leaf emergence is the subject of ongoing debate.
              Here we use a continuous development model in combination with
              time series of land surface phenology measurements from MODIS to
              quantify the relative importance of photoperiod and thermal
              forcing in controlling the timing of canopy greenup in eastern
              temperate and boreal forests of North America. The model
              accurately predicts biogeographic and interannual variation in
              the timing of greenup across the study region (median RMSE = 4.6
              days, median bias = 0.30 days). Results reveal strong
              biogeographic variation in the period prior to greenup when
              temperature and photoperiod influence greenup that covaries with
              the importance of photoperiod versus thermal controls.
              Photoperiod control on leaf emergence is dominant in warmer
              climates, but exerts only modest influence on the timing of leaf
              emergence in colder climates. Results from models estimated using
              ground-based observations of cloned lilac are consistent with
              those from remote sensing, which supports the realism of remote
              sensing-based models. Overall, results from this study suggest
              that apparent changes in the sensitivity of trees to temperature
              are modest and reflect a trade-off between decreased sensitivity
              to temperature and increased photoperiod control, and identify a
              transition in the relative importance of temperature versus
              photoperiod near the 10 °C isotherm in mean annual temperature.
              This suggests that the timing of leaf emergence will continue to
              move earlier as the climate warms, and that the magnitude of
              change will be more pronounced in colder regions with mean annual
              temperatures below 10 °C.",

              the species level, trait combinations depend on trade-offs
              representing different ecological strategies, but at the
              community level trait combinations are expected to be decoupled
              from these trade-offs because different strategies can facilitate
              co-existence within communities. A key question is to what extent
              community-level trait composition is globally filtered and how
              well it is related to global versus local environmental drivers.
              Here, we perform a global, plot-level analysis of
              trait-environment relationships, using a database with more than
              1.1 million vegetation plots and 26,632 plant species with trait
              information. Although we found a strong filtering of 17
              functional traits, similar climate and soil conditions support
              communities differing greatly in mean trait values. The two main
              community trait axes that capture half of the global trait
              variation (plant stature and resource acquisitiveness) reflect
              the trade-offs at the species level but are weakly associated
              with climate and soil conditions at the global scale. Similarly,
              within-plot trait variation does not vary systematically with
              macro-environment. Our results indicate that, at fine spatial
              grain, macro-environmental drivers are much less important for
              functional trait composition than has been assumed from floristic
              analyses restricted to co-occurrence in large grid cells.
              Instead, trait combinations seem to be predominantly filtered by
              local-scale factors such as disturbance, fine-scale soil

              and in differently managed grasslands remains challenging, mainly
              because a limited number of trait measurements are available and
              field campaigns are time-consuming. Here, we derived $\alpha$-
              and $\beta$-FD indices based on SLA measured in the field and
              estimated from optical satellite data by using molecular
              absorption profiles of leaves in canopies. We inverted the 1-D
              columnar radiative transfer model PROSAIL using Sentinel-2

              FD, whereas on a regional scale, parcel size and the uniformity
              of agricultural practices control trait diversity. Our results

              usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing
              can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective
              manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range
              of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to
              the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent
              years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging
              spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral

              ascribed a high potential in capturing those traits and their

              reflectance-based retrieval methods are either statistical
              (relying on empirical observations) or physically-based (based on
              inversions of a radiative transfer model, RTM). Both trait
              retrieval approaches remain poorly investigated regarding
              phenology. However, within the phenology of a plant, its leaf
              constituents, canopy structure, and the presence of
              phenology-related organs (i.e., flowers or inflorescence) vary
              considerably -- and so does its reflectance. We, therefore,
              addressed the question of how plant phenology affects the
              predictive performance of both statistical and RTM-based methods
              and how this effect differs between traits. For a complete
              growing season, we weekly measured traits of 45 herbaceous plant
              species together with hyperspectral canopy reflectance (ASD
              FieldSpec III). Plants were grown in an experimental setup. The
              investigated traits comprised Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the leaf
              traits chlorophyll, anthocyanins, carotenoids, equivalent water
              thickness, and leaf mass per area. We compared the predictive
              performances of PLSR models and three variants of PROSAIL
              inversions based on (1) all observations and based on (2) a
              phenological subset where flowering plants were excluded and only
              those observations most suitable for modeling were kept. Our
              results show that both statistical and RTM-based trait retrievals
              were largely affected by phenology. For carotenoids for example,
              R2 decreased from 0.58 at non-flowering canopies to 0.25 at 100\%
              flowering canopies. Temporal trends were diverse. LAI and
              equivalent water thickness were best estimated earlier in the
              growing season; chlorophyll and carotenoids towards senescence.
              PLSR models showed generally higher bias than the PROSAIL-based
              retrieval approaches. Lookup-table inversion of PROSAIL in
              combination with a continuous wavelet transformation of
              reflectance showed highest accuracies. We found RTM-based
              retrieval not to be as accurate and transferable as previously
              indicated. Our results suggest that phenology is essential for
              accurate retrieval of plant functional traits and varies
              depending on the studied species and functional traits,

              using 4-Scale and SAIL canopy radiative transfer models for woody
              and non-woody vegetation, respectively. Secondly, the modelled

              functional types (PFTs). Modelled results show strong
              relationships with field measurements, particularly for deciduous
              broadleaf forests (R2 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.25 $\mu$g cm-2; p <

              $\mu$g cm-2; p < 0.001). When the modelled results from all PFTs

              ChlLeaf remained good (R2 = 0.47, RMSE = 10.79 $\mu$g cm-2; p <
              0.001). This result is an improvement on the relationship between
              measured ChlLeaf and a commonly used chlorophyll-sensitive
              spectral vegetation index; the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll
              Index (MTCI; R2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). The global maps show large

              representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then
              aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial
              abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using

              Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along
              with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide
              associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression

              new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing

              of estimating nitrogen using radiative transfer models given the
              correlation between protein and nitrogen. However, such a revised
              leaf model has not been tested for the estimation of leaf
              nitrogen at the canopy level. In this study, a canopy reflectance
              model INFORM, coupled with the revised PROSPECT-5 model, was used
              to retrieve leaf and canopy nitrogen content in a mixed temperate
              forest using the wavelengths of 800--2500 nm from airborne
              hyperspectral imagery. Ecological criteria were applied to the
              parameterization of the model to reduce unrealistic combinations
              of input parameters. Global sensitivity analysis showed that leaf
              protein played a small but distinct role in driving the variation
              of canopy reflectance in the INFORM model. More accurate
              estimation was obtained for canopy nitrogen content (R2 = 0.64,
              RMSE = 1.90, NRMSE = 0.18) than leaf nitrogen content (R2 = 0.46,
              RMSE = 3.79e-05, NRMSE = 0.19). Moreover, inversion techniques,
              particularly regularized look-up tables, further improved the
              estimation accuracies compared to the original tables. Our
              results indicate that leaf and canopy nitrogen content can be
              retrieved successfully at the canopy level by inversion of
              INFORM. Both the direct and indirect effects of nitrogen on
              canopy reflectance are important for nitrogen estimation. The
              maps of leaf and canopy nitrogen content are the first to be
              generated using inversion of coupled leaf-canopy models, and the
              spatial variation of foliar nitrogen appears to be reasonable and
              consistent with ecological knowledge.",

               have shaped the wide variety of plant life strategies,
               especially in highly diverse ecosystems like tropical forests.
               Some evidence suggests that species have diversified across a
               gradient of ecological strategies, with different plant tissues
               converging to optimize resource use across environmental
               gradients. Alternative hypotheses propose that species have
               diversified following independent selection on different
               tissues, resulting in a decoupling of trait syndromes across
               organs. To shed light on the subject, we assembled an
               unprecedented dataset combining 19 leaf, stem and root traits
               for 1467 tropical tree species inventoried across 71 0.1-ha
               plots spanning broad environmental gradients in French Guiana.
               Nearly 50\% of the overall functional heterogeneity was
               expressed along four orthogonal dimensions, after accounting for
               phylogenetic dependences among species. The first dimension
               related to fine root functioning, while the second and third
               dimensions depicted two decoupled leaf economics spectra, and
               the fourth dimension encompassed a wood economics spectrum.
               Traits involved in orthogonal functional strategies, five leaf
               traits in particular but also trunk bark thickness, were
               consistently associated with a same gradient of soil texture and
               nutrient availability. Root traits did not show any significant
               association with edaphic variation, possibly because of the
               prevailing influence of other factors (mycorrhizal symbiosis,
               phylogenetic constraints). Our study emphasises the existence of
               multiple functional dimensions that allow tropical tree species
               to optimize their performance in a given environment, bringing
               new insights into the debate around the presence of a whole
               plant economic spectrum in tropical forest tree communities. It
               also emphasizes the key role that soil heterogeneity plays in
               shaping tree species assembly. The extent to which different
               organs are decoupled and respond to environmental gradients may
               also help to improve our predictions of species distribution
               changes in responses to habitat modification and environmental

              deep understanding of their impacts on ET is crucial for forest
              water management and sustainable development in changing
              environments. However, the independent effects of meteorological
              conditions and soil moisture on ET are not clear because their
              impacts occur concurrently under natural environmental
              conditions. In this study, a relatively simple but
              mechanism-based forest stand ET model that couples the effects of
              the reference ET (ETo) and relative extractable water (REW) in
              the 0--60 cm soil layer was developed to quantify the independent
              impacts of ETo and REW on ET. The model was established based on
              observed stand transpiration, forest floor ET, meteorological
              conditions, and soil water content obtained on non-rainfall days
              of the 2015, 2016, and 2019 growing seasons from a larch (Larix
              principis-rupprechtii) plantation in Northwest China. The
              following key results were obtained. (1) At this sub-humid site,
              the weather-dependent ET increased linearly with rising ETo;
              daily ET initially increased rapidly with rising REW, and then
              gradually reached a threshold; thereafter, it tended to be
              stable. The response could be described by an exponential
              saturation function. (2) The daily stand ET model that coupled
              these response functions to individual factors was determined as
              ET = 0. 785 $\times$ [ETo $\times$ (1 -- EXP(--13.567REW))]. (3)
              The contributions of ETo and REW were further determined using
              the new ET model, and the results show that ETo was the main
              driving factor affecting the ET variations in three different
              hydrological years compared with REW and the interaction of ETo
              and REW. Compared with those in the normal year 2015, REW and ETo
              limited the ET variation in the dry year 2016 by 13.1\% and
              7.3\%, respectively, and ETo limited the ET variation in the wet
              year 2019 by 8.8\%. Our study provides a simple and feasible
              method for separating the meteorological conditions (i.e., ETo)

              in site or regional areas, but few on leaf litter, especially for
              tree species with a wide distribution. Here, we collected 57 leaf
              litter samples of Chinese fir from 19 sites across subtropical

              chemistry, which were assessed through soil sampling at the 19
              sites. The results showed that the mean leaf litter C, N and P
              concentrations (namely nutrient resorption proficiency, NuRP)
              were 458.3 $\pm$ 4.0 mg g−1, 8.9 $\pm$ 0.3 mg g−1, and 0.46 $\pm$
              0.02 mg g−1, respectively. The mean C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios were

              proficiency of the leaf litter was at intermediate level for both

              lowlands of northern Germany, replacing former broadleaf forests
              (primarily European beech, Fagus sylvatica L.). This
              transformation belongs to the world's largest broadleaf-conifer
              forest conversions; yet, the belowground consequences of this
              species shift are poorly studied. Based on root coring, an
              ingrowth core study and root morphological analyses, we compared
              (i) the bio- and necromass, productivity and morphology of fine
              roots in pairs of beech and pine stands and (ii) analyzed the
              species' fine root system response to variation in soil
              properties and climatic conditions across a climate
              continentality gradient. Fine root biomass was on average 6.5
              times higher (237 vs. 37 g m−2) and fine root productivity 1.9
              times greater (147 vs. 77 g m−2 yr−1, difference not significant)
              in beech than pine stands. Beech responded with considerable
              plasticity in fine root system size and fine root morphology to
              variation in soil acidity and soil fertility and to the
              contrasting growing conditions in organic layer and mineral soil,
              but was not responsive to the climatic gradient. In contrast,
              pine modified fine root biomass and root morphology in response
              to precipitation and temperature, but did not respond to soil
              chemistry and fertility. Pine had a somewhat higher mean fine
              root diameter and also higher specific fine root surface area
              than beech, while its fine root tip abundance and mean fine root
              lifespan were lower than in beech (4 vs. 13 months). We conclude
              that the conversion of broadleaf (beech) to coniferous (pine)
              forest is accompanied by marked root system changes, notably the
              reduction of standing fine root biomass and productivity and an
              apparently contrasting belowground responsiveness to climatic and
              edaphic changes, with possible consequences for the trees'
              susceptibility to climate-warming and drought.",
