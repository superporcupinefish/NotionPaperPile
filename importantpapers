  title    = "Relationships between leaf pigment content and spectral
              reflectance across a wide range of species, leaf structures and
              developmental stages",
  author   = "Sims, Daniel A and Gamon, John A",
  abstract = "Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the
              physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral
              reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment
              estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been
              developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in
              most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most
              a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can
              be applied across species with varying leaf structural
              characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop
              spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are
              relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation
              and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies
              without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of
              spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments
              occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously
              published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations
              with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of
              species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance
              appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By
              developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of
              differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to
              significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content.
              We also found that an index based on the first derivative of
              reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf
              structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not
              significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral
              reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin
              indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we
              found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally
              developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes)
              was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves.
              This result has important implications for the interpretation of
              PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results
              demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species
              with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for
              extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new
              possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in
              heterogeneous natural environments.",

              to explain resource allocation strategies, carbohydrate storage
              is often omitted. Belowground storage organs are the centre of
              herb perennation, yet little is known about the role of their
              turnover, anatomy and carbohydrate storage in relation to the
              aboveground economic spectrum. METHODS: We collected aboveground
              traits associated with the economic spectrum, storage organ
              turnover traits, storage organ inner structure traits and storage
              carbohydrate concentrations for ~80 temperate meadow species. KEY
              RESULTS: The suites of belowground traits were largely
              independent of one another, but there was significant correlation
              of the aboveground traits with both inner structure and storage
              carbohydrates. Anatomical traits diverged according to leaf
              nitrogen concentration on the one hand and vessel area and dry
              matter content on the other; carbohydrates separated along
              gradients of leaf nitrogen concentration and plant height.
              CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our expectations, aboveground traits and
              not storage organ turnover were correlated with anatomy and
              storage carbohydrates. Belowground traits associated with the
              aboveground economic spectrum also did not fall clearly within
              the fast-slow economic continuum, thus indicating the presence of
              a more complicated economic space. Our study implies that the
              generally overlooked role of storage within the plant economic
              spectrum represents an important dimension of plant strategy.",

  abstract = "Understanding variation in leaf functional traits-including rates
              of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen
              and phosphorus-is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology.
              When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically
              increase with leaf mass per area (LMA) within species but are
              roughly independent of LMA across the global flora. LMA is
              determined by mass components with different biological
              functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines
              metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and
              structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (LL). A
              possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is
              that most LMA variation within species is associated with
              variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most LMA variation
              across the global flora is associated with variation in
              structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that
              (i) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf
              area should increase strongly with LMA across species assemblages
              with low LL variance but should increase weakly with LMA across
              species assemblages with high LL variance and that (ii)
              controlling for LL variation should increase the strength of the
              above LMA relationships. We present analyses of intra- and
              interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites
              and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global
              dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our
              analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait
              relationships exhibited by different leaf assemblages can be
              understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and
              structural mass components contribute to LMA variation in a given

              ecosystem status and function (e.g. carbon and water exchange
              between the land surface and the atmosphere). However, deriving
              accurate LAI measurements at regular temporal intervals remains
              challenging, requiring either destructive sampling or manual
              collection of canopy gap fraction measurements at discrete time

              continuous LAI data, simply derived from above and below canopy
              measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the
              Borden Forest Research Station from 1999 to 2018. We compared LAI
              derived using the four PAR-based methods to independent
              measurements of LAI from optical methods and the MODIS satellite
              LAI product. LAI derived from all four PAR-based methods captured
              the seasonal changes in observed and remotely sensed LAI and
              showed a close linear correspondence with one another (R2 of 0.55

              LAI-2000 measurements). A PAR-based method using Miller's
              Integral theorem showed the strongest linear relationship with
              LAI-2000 measurements (R2=0.84, p<0.001, SE=0.40). In many years

  abstract = "The timing of leaf emergence in temperate and boreal forests is
              changing, which has profound implications for a wide array of
              ecosystem processes and services. Spring phenology models, which
              have been widely used to predict the timing of leaf emergence,
              generally assume that a combination of photoperiod and thermal
              forcing control when leaves emerge. However, the exact nature and
              magnitude of how photoperiod and temperature individually and
              jointly control leaf emergence is the subject of ongoing debate.
              Here we use a continuous development model in combination with
              time series of land surface phenology measurements from MODIS to
              quantify the relative importance of photoperiod and thermal
              forcing in controlling the timing of canopy greenup in eastern
              temperate and boreal forests of North America. The model
              accurately predicts biogeographic and interannual variation in
              the timing of greenup across the study region (median RMSE = 4.6
              days, median bias = 0.30 days). Results reveal strong
              biogeographic variation in the period prior to greenup when
              temperature and photoperiod influence greenup that covaries with
              the importance of photoperiod versus thermal controls.
              Photoperiod control on leaf emergence is dominant in warmer
              climates, but exerts only modest influence on the timing of leaf
              emergence in colder climates. Results from models estimated using
              ground-based observations of cloned lilac are consistent with
              those from remote sensing, which supports the realism of remote
              sensing-based models. Overall, results from this study suggest
              that apparent changes in the sensitivity of trees to temperature
              are modest and reflect a trade-off between decreased sensitivity
              to temperature and increased photoperiod control, and identify a
              transition in the relative importance of temperature versus
              photoperiod near the 10 °C isotherm in mean annual temperature.
              This suggests that the timing of leaf emergence will continue to
              move earlier as the climate warms, and that the magnitude of
              change will be more pronounced in colder regions with mean annual
              temperatures below 10 °C.",

              the species level, trait combinations depend on trade-offs
              representing different ecological strategies, but at the
              community level trait combinations are expected to be decoupled
              from these trade-offs because different strategies can facilitate
              co-existence within communities. A key question is to what extent
              community-level trait composition is globally filtered and how
              well it is related to global versus local environmental drivers.
              Here, we perform a global, plot-level analysis of
              trait-environment relationships, using a database with more than
              1.1 million vegetation plots and 26,632 plant species with trait
              information. Although we found a strong filtering of 17
              functional traits, similar climate and soil conditions support
              communities differing greatly in mean trait values. The two main
              community trait axes that capture half of the global trait
              variation (plant stature and resource acquisitiveness) reflect
              the trade-offs at the species level but are weakly associated
              with climate and soil conditions at the global scale. Similarly,
              within-plot trait variation does not vary systematically with
              macro-environment. Our results indicate that, at fine spatial
              grain, macro-environmental drivers are much less important for
              functional trait composition than has been assumed from floristic
              analyses restricted to co-occurrence in large grid cells.
              Instead, trait combinations seem to be predominantly filtered by
              local-scale factors such as disturbance, fine-scale soil
              conditions, niche partitioning and biotic interactions.",

              at regional scales, and its scale dependence is poorly
              understood. Capturing trait variations at distinct spatial scales
              and in differently managed grasslands remains challenging, mainly
              because a limited number of trait measurements are available and
              field campaigns are time-consuming. Here, we derived $\alpha$-
              and $\beta$-FD indices based on SLA measured in the field and
              estimated from optical satellite data by using molecular
              absorption profiles of leaves in canopies. We inverted the 1-D
              columnar radiative transfer model PROSAIL using Sentinel-2

              FD, whereas on a regional scale, parcel size and the uniformity
              of agricultural practices control trait diversity. Our results

              Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and

              biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better

              situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is
              usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing
              can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective
              manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range
              of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to
              the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent
              years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging
              spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral
              information content. However, questions regarding the complex
              drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of

              diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be

              ascribed a high potential in capturing those traits and their
              spatiotemporal patterns. In vegetation remote sensing,
              reflectance-based retrieval methods are either statistical
              (relying on empirical observations) or physically-based (based on
              inversions of a radiative transfer model, RTM). Both trait
              retrieval approaches remain poorly investigated regarding
              phenology. However, within the phenology of a plant, its leaf
              constituents, canopy structure, and the presence of
              phenology-related organs (i.e., flowers or inflorescence) vary
              considerably -- and so does its reflectance. We, therefore,
              addressed the question of how plant phenology affects the
              predictive performance of both statistical and RTM-based methods
              and how this effect differs between traits. For a complete
              growing season, we weekly measured traits of 45 herbaceous plant
              species together with hyperspectral canopy reflectance (ASD
              FieldSpec III). Plants were grown in an experimental setup. The
              investigated traits comprised Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the leaf
              traits chlorophyll, anthocyanins, carotenoids, equivalent water
              thickness, and leaf mass per area. We compared the predictive
              performances of PLSR models and three variants of PROSAIL
              inversions based on (1) all observations and based on (2) a
              phenological subset where flowering plants were excluded and only
              those observations most suitable for modeling were kept. Our
              results show that both statistical and RTM-based trait retrievals
              were largely affected by phenology. For carotenoids for example,
              R2 decreased from 0.58 at non-flowering canopies to 0.25 at 100\%
              flowering canopies. Temporal trends were diverse. LAI and
              equivalent water thickness were best estimated earlier in the
              growing season; chlorophyll and carotenoids towards senescence.
              PLSR models showed generally higher bias than the PROSAIL-based
              retrieval approaches. Lookup-table inversion of PROSAIL in
              combination with a continuous wavelet transformation of
              reflectance showed highest accuracies. We found RTM-based
              retrieval not to be as accurate and transferable as previously
              indicated. Our results suggest that phenology is essential for
              accurate retrieval of plant functional traits and varies
              depending on the studied species and functional traits,

              using 4-Scale and SAIL canopy radiative transfer models for woody
              and non-woody vegetation, respectively. Secondly, the modelled
              leaf-level reflectance was input into the PROSPECT leaf-level

              sample measurements at 28 field locations, and covering six plant
              functional types (PFTs). Modelled results show strong
              relationships with field measurements, particularly for deciduous
              broadleaf forests (R2 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.25 $\mu$g cm-2; p <

              $\mu$g cm-2; p < 0.001). When the modelled results from all PFTs
              were considered together, the overall relationship with measured
              ChlLeaf remained good (R2 = 0.47, RMSE = 10.79 $\mu$g cm-2; p <
              0.001). This result is an improvement on the relationship between

              spectral vegetation index; the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll
              Index (MTCI; R2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). The global maps show large

              broadleaf forests presenting the highest leaf chlorophyll values,
              with global annual median values of 54.4 $\mu$g cm-2. Distinct

              sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and
              up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses
              random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the
              database (> 45\% of missing entries) and maximizes the global
              representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then
              aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial
              abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using
              Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances,
              representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with
              nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are
              applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS
              pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were
              compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The
              best model (random forests regression) shows good precision
              (normalized RMSE$\leq$ 20\%) and goodness of fit (averaged
              Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along
              with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide
              associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression

              new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing

              attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide
              the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at

              processes, plant growth, and ecosystem functioning, which has
              been proposed as one of the essential biodiversity variables.
              Nitrogen has been quantified by a number of empirical approaches
              using hyperspectral data, but the retrieval of nitrogen through a
              physically based approach remains a challenge. A recent study by
              Wang et al. (2015a) has revealed that leaf protein can be
              successfully estimated from fresh leaf spectra using a revised
              leaf radiative transfer model PROPECT-5 which incorporated the
              effects of leaf protein and cellulose + lignin on leaf
              reflectance and transmittance. This provides a potential approach
              of estimating nitrogen using radiative transfer models given the
              correlation between protein and nitrogen. However, such a revised
              leaf model has not been tested for the estimation of leaf
              nitrogen at the canopy level. In this study, a canopy reflectance
              model INFORM, coupled with the revised PROSPECT-5 model, was used
              to retrieve leaf and canopy nitrogen content in a mixed temperate
              forest using the wavelengths of 800--2500 nm from airborne
              hyperspectral imagery. Ecological criteria were applied to the
              parameterization of the model to reduce unrealistic combinations
              of input parameters. Global sensitivity analysis showed that leaf
              protein played a small but distinct role in driving the variation
              of canopy reflectance in the INFORM model. More accurate
              estimation was obtained for canopy nitrogen content (R2 = 0.64,
              RMSE = 1.90, NRMSE = 0.18) than leaf nitrogen content (R2 = 0.46,
              RMSE = 3.79e-05, NRMSE = 0.19). Moreover, inversion techniques,
              particularly regularized look-up tables, further improved the
              estimation accuracies compared to the original tables. Our
              results indicate that leaf and canopy nitrogen content can be
              retrieved successfully at the canopy level by inversion of
              INFORM. Both the direct and indirect effects of nitrogen on
              canopy reflectance are important for nitrogen estimation. The
              maps of leaf and canopy nitrogen content are the first to be
              generated using inversion of coupled leaf-canopy models, and the
              spatial variation of foliar nitrogen appears to be reasonable and
              consistent with ecological knowledge.",

               have shaped the wide variety of plant life strategies,
               especially in highly diverse ecosystems like tropical forests.
               Some evidence suggests that species have diversified across a
               gradient of ecological strategies, with different plant tissues
               converging to optimize resource use across environmental
               gradients. Alternative hypotheses propose that species have
               diversified following independent selection on different
               tissues, resulting in a decoupling of trait syndromes across
               organs. To shed light on the subject, we assembled an
               unprecedented dataset combining 19 leaf, stem and root traits
               for 1467 tropical tree species inventoried across 71 0.1-ha
               plots spanning broad environmental gradients in French Guiana.
               Nearly 50\% of the overall functional heterogeneity was
               expressed along four orthogonal dimensions, after accounting for
               phylogenetic dependences among species. The first dimension
               related to fine root functioning, while the second and third
               dimensions depicted two decoupled leaf economics spectra, and
               the fourth dimension encompassed a wood economics spectrum.
               Traits involved in orthogonal functional strategies, five leaf
               traits in particular but also trunk bark thickness, were
               consistently associated with a same gradient of soil texture and
               nutrient availability. Root traits did not show any significant
               association with edaphic variation, possibly because of the
               prevailing influence of other factors (mycorrhizal symbiosis,
               phylogenetic constraints). Our study emphasises the existence of
               multiple functional dimensions that allow tropical tree species
               to optimize their performance in a given environment, bringing
               new insights into the debate around the presence of a whole
               plant economic spectrum in tropical forest tree communities. It
               also emphasizes the key role that soil heterogeneity plays in
               shaping tree species assembly. The extent to which different
               organs are decoupled and respond to environmental gradients may
               also help to improve our predictions of species distribution
               changes in responses to habitat modification and environmental

              deep understanding of their impacts on ET is crucial for forest
              water management and sustainable development in changing
              environments. However, the independent effects of meteorological
              conditions and soil moisture on ET are not clear because their
              impacts occur concurrently under natural environmental
              conditions. In this study, a relatively simple but
              mechanism-based forest stand ET model that couples the effects of
              the reference ET (ETo) and relative extractable water (REW) in
              the 0--60 cm soil layer was developed to quantify the independent
              impacts of ETo and REW on ET. The model was established based on
              observed stand transpiration, forest floor ET, meteorological
              conditions, and soil water content obtained on non-rainfall days
              of the 2015, 2016, and 2019 growing seasons from a larch (Larix
              principis-rupprechtii) plantation in Northwest China. The
              following key results were obtained. (1) At this sub-humid site,
              the weather-dependent ET increased linearly with rising ETo;
              daily ET initially increased rapidly with rising REW, and then
              gradually reached a threshold; thereafter, it tended to be
              stable. The response could be described by an exponential
              saturation function. (2) The daily stand ET model that coupled
              these response functions to individual factors was determined as
              ET = 0. 785 $\times$ [ETo $\times$ (1 -- EXP(--13.567REW))]. (3)
              The contributions of ETo and REW were further determined using
              the new ET model, and the results show that ETo was the main
              driving factor affecting the ET variations in three different
              hydrological years compared with REW and the interaction of ETo
              and REW. Compared with those in the normal year 2015, REW and ETo
              limited the ET variation in the dry year 2016 by 13.1\% and
              7.3\%, respectively, and ETo limited the ET variation in the wet
              year 2019 by 8.8\%. Our study provides a simple and feasible
              method for separating the meteorological conditions (i.e., ETo)
              and soil moisture controls on ET variations, and can improve the

              sites. The results showed that the mean leaf litter C, N and P
              concentrations (namely nutrient resorption proficiency, NuRP)
              were 458.3 $\pm$ 4.0 mg g−1, 8.9 $\pm$ 0.3 mg g−1, and 0.46 $\pm$

  abstract = "Estimates of surface reflectance from observed radiance are
              fundamentally tied to the accuracy of the radiative transfer
              models used to simulate the interaction of light with the
              atmosphere and surface. These radiative transfer models are
              parameterized by a wide range of quantities, ranging from
              observation and solar geometries to assumptions about atmospheric
              conditions, including vertical distributions aerosols and water
              vapor as well as the atmospheric composition. However, current
              retrieval approaches cannot represent this variability; they are
              limited by computational expense to a coarsely-spaced look up
              table (LUT) of just a few parameters. Here, we propose a new
              method called sRTMnet that facilitates the efficient creation of
              dense LUT grids that fully capture radiative transfer's inherent
              nonlinearity. sRTMnet uses a combination of fast, reduced-order
              radiative transfer modeling coupled with neural-network-based
              emulation to realize a computational speedup of over 3000$\times$
              while maintaining the accuracy of a high-fidelity RTM. We
              demonstrate the accuracy of sRTMnet in multiple ways. We show
              that neural-network-based emulation delivers accurate atmospheric
              properties using robust testing sets. We then use acquisitions
              from the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer - next
              generation (AVIRIS-NG) to show near identical surface reflectance
              estimates with sRTMnet and a high-fidelity radiative transfer
              model (MODTRAN). Finally, we show how distributions of mapped
              minerals remain consistent when using the sRTMnet-based
              reflectance. Given these results, sRTMnet will be utilized for
              the upcoming Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation
              (EMIT, an imaging spectrometer destined for the international
              space station in 2022). In addition to speed and accuracy, the
              fully open-source nature of sRTMnet (including simulation and
              emulation), provides a pathway for high-resolution imaging
              spectroscopy reflectance retrievals at the global scale.",

  title    = "Moving beyond the incorrect but useful paradigm: reevaluating
              big-leaf and multilayer plant canopies to model
              biosphere-atmosphere fluxes -- a review",
  author   = "Bonan, Gordon B and Patton, Edward G and Finnigan, John J and
              Baldocchi, Dennis D and Harman, Ian N",
  abstract = "The land surface models that provide surface fluxes of energy and
              mass to the atmosphere in weather forecast and climate models
              typically represent plant canopies as a homogenous single layer
              of phytomass without vertical structure (commonly referred to as
              a big leaf). This modeling paradigm harkens back to a
              30--40-year-old debate about whether big-leaf models adequately
              simulate fluxes for vegetated surfaces compared to more complex
              and computationally costly multilayer canopy models. This article
              revisits that scientific debate. We review the early literature
              to place our findings in context and discuss recent advancements
              in roughness sublayer theory, observations of canopy structure
              and leaf traits, and computational methods that facilitate the
              use of multilayer models. Using a model with variable vertical
              resolution, we compare a multilayer canopy representation with
              the equivalent one-layer canopy to ask how well the one-layer
              canopy replicates the multilayer benchmark and to identify why
              differences occur. Comparisons with flux tower measurements at
              several forest sites spanning multiple years show that sensible
              heat flux, latent heat flux, gross primary production, and
              friction velocity for the one-layer canopy degrade in comparison
              to the benchmark multilayer canopy. For the forest sites
              considered, 5--10 canopy layers sufficiently reproduce the
              observed fluxes. Vertical variation of within-canopy air
              temperature, specific humidity, and wind speed in the multilayer
              canopy alters fluxes compared with the one-layer canopy. The
              vertical profile of leaf water potential, in which the upper
              canopy is water-stressed on dry soils, also causes differences
              between the one-layer and multilayer canopies. The differences
              between one-layer and multilayer canopies suggest that the land
              surface modeling community should revisit the big-leaf surface
              flux parameterizations used in models.",

  abstract = "Dense time series of optical satellite imagery describing
              vegetation activity provide essential information for the
              efficient and regular monitoring of vegetation. Nevertheless, the
              temporal resolution of optical sensors is strongly affected by
              cloud cover, resulting in significant missing information. The
              use of complementary acquisitions, such as Synthetic Aperture
              Radar (SAR) data, opens the door to the development of new
              multi-sensor methodologies aiming at the reconstruction of
              missing information. However, the joint exploitation of new radar
              and optical missions, such as the Sentinel, raises new challenges
              given the different nature and response of the two data sources.
              In this work, the SenRVM methodology is proposed as a new
              multi-sensor approach to regress SAR time series towards
              Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A deep Recurrent
              Neural Network architecture which integrates SAR acquisitions and
              ancillary data is adopted. The regression task permits a
              continuous optical temporal resolution of 6 days. Multiple
              experiments are carried out to assess the SenRVM framework by
              studying two large-scale areas in France. Through an extensive
              interpretation of the results, SenRVM is evaluated on three main
              vegetation types (grasslands, crops, and forests). High accurate
              results (R2 > 0.83 and MAE < 0.05) over more than 140,000
              vegetation polygons are obtained, both for multi-class and
              class-specific models. The importance of the SenRVM input
              features is discussed through an ablation study, highlighting
              that the relevance of the features differs for the various
              classes. The good performances of SenRVM are assessed by
              evaluating the quality of the reconstruction over short- and
              long-term data gaps. Results are compared to five
              state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, some preliminary
              experiments are first carried out to show how SenRVM results
              could be used to improve the existing cloud \& shadow masks. The
              recovering of time series breaks caused by vegetation cover
              changes is also illustrated.",

              reaching maturity with recently launched and upcoming
              science-driven missions, e.g. PRecursore IperSpettrale della
              Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) and Environmental Mapping and
              Analysis Program (EnMAP), respectively. Moreover, the
              high-priority mission candidate Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging
              Mission for the Environment (CHIME) is expected to globally
              provide routine hyperspectral observations to support new and
              enhanced services for, among others, sustainable agricultural and
              biodiversity management. Thanks to the provision of contiguous
              visible-to-shortwave infrared spectral data, hyperspectral
              missions open enhanced opportunities for the development of
              new-generation retrieval models of multiple vegetation traits.
              Among these, canopy nitrogen content (CNC) is one of the most
              promising variables given its importance for agricultural
              monitoring applications. This work presents the first hybrid CNC
              retrieval model for the operational delivery from spaceborne
              imaging spectroscopy data. To achieve this, physically-based
              models were combined with machine learning regression algorithms
              and active learning (AL). The key concepts involve: (1) coupling
              the radiative transfer models PROSPECT-PRO and SAIL for the
              generation of a wide range of vegetation states as training data,
              (2) using dimensionality reduction to deal with collinearity, (3)
              applying an AL technique in combination with Gaussian process
              regression (GPR) for fine-tuning the training dataset on in field
              collected data, and (4) adding non-vegetated spectra to enable
              the model to deal with spectral heterogeneity in the image. The
              final CNC model was successfully validated against field data
              achieving a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.4 g/m2 and
              coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7. The model was applied
              to a PRISMA image acquired over agricultural areas in the North
              of Munich, Germany. Mapping aboveground CNC yielded reliable
              estimates over the whole landscape and meaningful associated
              uncertainties. These promising results demonstrate the
              feasibility of routinely quantifying CNC from space, such as in
              an operational context as part of the future CHIME mission.",

               and soil-dependent emergent vegetation. Abstract Identification
               of materials based on spectral reflectance is confounded by
               variations in reflectance magnitude that are independent of the
               spectral shape. Local variations such as viewing/illumination
               angles, multiscale soil surface roughness that causes shadows
               and redistributes light, and soil moisture content, all drive
               changes in magnitude that are distinct from the spectral
               variations, and complicate identification and modeling of
               targets based on spectral features. Normalization metrics that
               remove magnitude variations can greatly clarify the nature of
               spectral differences, simplifying interpretation of reflectance
               features in spectral imagery. Normalized difference measures are
               particularly useful because of the simplicity of the
               computation, the convenient scaling, and the ease with which the
               normalized difference procedure can be extended to multiple
               dimensions. The two-dimensional normalized difference space
               described here allows for improved discrimination among bare
               soils and emergent vegetation when there are multiple soil types
               in the scene. A 2-D model of soil-specific change in vegetation
               density is presented. An application of the vector index to
               mineral identification and mapping is also presented, with an

  abstract  = "In light of the ongoing global biodiversity crisis, the urge to
               monitor and map terrestrial plant biodiversity at large spatial
               extents has spurred research on adequate quantitative methods.
               The use of spectral diversity metrics from different remote
               sensing platforms has emerged as a promising tool for such
               biodiversity assessments. Satellite remote sensing presents the
               next frontier for implementation of these methods to assess
               plant diversity with spatial and temporal continuity at truly
               regional or global scales. However, the question of what exactly
               is monitored by spectral diversity metrics from relatively
               coarse multi-spectral satellite observations has remained
               largely unanswered. In this research, we examined which
               components contribute to satellite remotely sensed spectral
               diversity. We assessed the relationships between spectral
               diversity and in-situ taxonomic and trait diversity, and
               evaluated the role of confounding factors, vegetation cover, and
               landscape morphology (slope and elevation), in shaping these
               relationships. Hereto, we used Sentinel-2 imagery and in-situ
               field trait and species count data collected in the
               Montesinho-Nogueira Natura 2000 site (Portugal) together with
               radiative transfer models to quantify the theoretical link
               between in-situ trait diversity and simulated spectral
               diversity. Through the use of linear mixed-effect models, our
               results highlight that variation in vegetation cover dominates
               the Sentinel-2's spectral diversity signal (contributing
               53--84\% of the R2marginal). The vegetation cover component
               encompasses spatial variability in canopy architecture traits as
               well as the fraction of bare soil and plant litter spectra.
               These elements together strongly impact the overall spectral
               diversity signal, as shown both in our radiative transfer
               simulations and empirical comparisons. Next to vegetation cover,
               we found that taxonomic diversity is a significant predictor and
               covariate of spectral diversity, while the role of leaf trait
               diversity appeared insignificant in our multispectral dataset.
               Variation in vegetation cover dominated the spectral diversity
               signal in our study while it is not necessarily correlated with
               plant diversity. We, therefore, recommend that future
               applications of multi-spectral diversity metrics consider the
               impact of vegetation cover, including soil variability and the
               role of morphological traits, in shaping leaf trait - canopy
               reflectance relationships to better understand the ambiguous
               performance of spectral diversity as a proxy of plant diversity.
               This will result in higher robustness, consistency, and
               scalability of spectral diversity metrics for predicting in-situ
               plant diversity across scales, sensors, and ecosystems in
               regional biodiversity assessments.",

  abstract = "Spatiotemporal image fusion is a potential way to resolve the
              constraint between the spatial and temporal resolutions of
              satellite images and has been developed rapidly in recent years.
              However, two key challenges related to fusion accuracy remain: a)
              reducing the uncertainty of image fusion caused by sensor
              differences and b) addressing strong temporal changes. To solve
              the above two issues, this paper presents the newly proposed
              Reliable and Adaptive Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (RASDF) method.
              In RASDF, the effects of four kinds of sensor differences on
              fusion are analyzed systematically. A reliability index is
              therefore proposed to describe the spatial distribution of the
              reliability in input data for image fusion. An optimization
              strategy based on the spatial distribution of the reliability
              quantified by the index is developed to improve the robustness of
              the fusion. In addition, an adaptive global unmixing model and an
              adaptive local unmixing model are constructed and utilized
              collaboratively to enhance the ability to retrieve strong
              temporal changes. The performance and robustness of RASDF were
              compared with six representative fusion methods for both real and
              simulated datasets covering both homogeneous and heterogeneous
              sites. Experimental results indicated that RASDF achieves a
              better performance and provides a more reliable image fusion
              solution in terms of reducing the impact of sensor differences on
              image fusion and retrieving strong temporal changes.",
